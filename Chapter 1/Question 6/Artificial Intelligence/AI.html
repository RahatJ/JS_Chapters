            Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized information technology. The new economy of information technology has shaped the way we are living. This special issue aims to report the latest advances in every aspect of artificial intelligence technology, including machine learning, data mining, computer vision, multiagent systems, evolutionary computation, and fuzzy logic.

Recently, AI algorithms have attracted close attention of researchers and have also been applied successfully to solve problems in engineering. Nevertheless, for large and complex problems, AI algorithms consume considerable computation time due to stochastic feature of the search approaches. Therefore, there is a potential requirement to develop efficient algorithm to find solutions under the limited resources, time, and money in real-world applications.

The aim of this special issue is to highlight the most significant recent developments on the topics of AI and to apply AI algorithms in real-life scenarios. Contributions containing new insights and findings in this field are welcome. Particular attention will be given to the following theme areas; however, it should be stressed that a broad range of submissions are encouraged. Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
